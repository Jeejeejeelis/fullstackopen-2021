The number of credits and the grade for the course are based on the total number of submitted exercises for parts 0-7 (including exercises marked with an asterisk).

Credits and grades are calculated as follows:
exercises   credits     grade
138	        7	        5
127	        6	        5
116	        5	        5
105	        5	        4
94	        5	        3
83	        5	        2
72	        5	        1

Current total = 62 + 8 = 70!
